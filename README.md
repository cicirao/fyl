For this project, I was trying to use APIs in order to add some SVGs to my web presence to add some fun since the topic was already boring enough. I used Google Chart and tried JQuery-UI for a while but gave it up soon. Google Chart was convenient and powerful. The only thing that bothered me was that the chart can not adapt to the size of the screen immediately, though it can fit the screen when refreshed. And I didn’t find a way to figure it out. I came up with the idea of using JQuery-UI was that I wanted a date selector widget. Though JQuery-UI did a great job on the date selector, that was only good for large screens: the pop-up windows can be too large to be displayed completely on a mobile device. Thus, I dropped this idea and used what I’d learned from the form project. And it seemed great.

Besides the new page, I also redesigned the homepage. I realized that the links in the blue boxes worked like a navigation. And when it was used on the phone, users had to take more efforts to approach the navigation since they were at the end of the page and users had to swipe down a lot. Thus, I did what I always wanted to do—add a hamburger menu! I still kept the two blue boxes there because I thought it would help users to navigate. And if javascript is blocked, users can still look around with the blue boxes. 

One bad thing that I’ve met is that I wrote one more </div> in my HTML. It has taken me a while to figure out the problem, and this is inefficient of me because it is hard to distinguish.

I also improved my single page a lot. The header of each page was set as fixed so that it was easy to travel around on the website. I applied CSS3 transition and Javascript to implement the hamburger menu, which was fun. However, I didn’t come up with good ideas to handle the situation that Javascript was blocked. So I just leave the menu displayed none since I also had the blue boxes navigation at the bottom. Besides the hamburger menu, I’ve removed the tweets stream to make the homepage clean.  I also followed the advices from Professor Stolley to set more appropriate media queries break-points and only use min-width, clean my HTML, and use Googles Fonts API to load my font families. These advices were great, and I made a great improvement, especially only use min-width. It made my code dry. What’s more, instead of putting the blue boxes aside, I left them at the bottom to make my pages consistent. 

Anyway, sometimes the tiny thing can make a difference. I would like to pay more attention to the subtle issues on web design.
